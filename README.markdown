*In some moment of craziness I thought: "Hey, I wish I have a program that tells me what episode should I watch today". So, I came up with this widget that does exactly that!.
(Incredible useful!! At least once a week. :-p )*

##README

Naruto Shippuden Episode List Widget is a tiny (but very tiny) widget for MacOS X Dashboard.
Once installed, this widget will parse information from [Wikipedia][2] so you can always have the latest information about the episodes and its releases dates.

Yeah, kind of simple Huh?! However, inside it has a quiet useful HTML/XML parser inspired in the Apple's [NSXMLParser][3] and [NSXMLParserDelegate][4] implemented in plain Javascript. If you don't want to use any of the big libraries around there then take a look at this small parser ;-)

Feel free to download it from [Apple's Dashboard Widget site][1] or get the latest source from here!. 

Its is completely written in javascript (off-course it uses Dashboard framework classes for the UI ♪)
